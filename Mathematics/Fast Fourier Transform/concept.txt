Discrete Time Fourier Series (aka. DTFS or DFT)
Fast Fourier Trasform Algorithm
Topdown inplace version took O(n log^2 n) due to splitting.
Bottom up version uses O(n) memory for amortized linear bit-reversal
Generally bottom up version are about 10 times faster then top down version
These version are for radix 2 Cooley-Tukey Algorithm.
